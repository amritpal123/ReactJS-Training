        <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan.
            He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by
            most of Konoha throughout his childhood.
            After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing
            his dream to become Hokage.
            In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a capable ninja, regarded as a hero
            both by the villagers, and soon after,
            the rest of the world, becoming known as the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū,
            literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
            He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve
            his dream and become the village's
            Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Background</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the
            second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails).
            He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his
            godfather.
            Orphaned, and not having anyone else to provide for him, Naruto received monthly income from the village in
            order to afford daily necessities.
            Naruto grew up not knowing who his parents were, receiving only his mother's surname, as Hiruzen wanted to
            protect Naruto from his father's enemies.
            Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their
            pain and losses caused by the disaster,
            while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly
            ostracised and resented Naruto for
            containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives, some even viewed Naruto as the
            Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade
            anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as
            their parents did.
            However, Naruto's peers emulated their parents' hatred of him, despite not knowing why. This social
            isolation caused Naruto to crave acknowledgement,
            which he would gain by pulling pranks.
